searchlight-assault-base=Directs adjacent turrets to snipe spotted foes, at great power cost.
searchlight-assault-alarm=Directs adjacent turrets to snipe spotted foes, at great power cost.
searchlight-assault-control=Directs attached turret to snipe spotted foes, at great power cost.
searchlight-assault-signal-interface=Sets the searchlight position according to supplied [virtual-signal=sl-x] and [virtual-signal=sl-y] coordinates (relative to searchlight).\n\nAlternatively, a supplied [virtual-signal=sl-radius] in degrees 1 - 360 can be used to set a cone-radius to limit search direction. In this mode, [virtual-signal=sl-rotation] will control the rotation of the cone around the searchlight's axis, and [virtual-signal=sl-minimum] & [virtual-signal=sl-maximum] will control the distance at which the light wanders from the searchlight.\n\n\nOutputs [virtual-signal=foe-x-position] and [virtual-signal=foe-y-position] coordinates of spotted foes (relative to world).\n\nWarn and Alarm states are output as 0 or 1 on [virtual-signal=sl-warn] and [virtual-signal=sl-alarm] respectively.\n\nOutputs own-position X & Y on [virtual-signal=sl-own-x] and [virtual-signal=sl-own-y] respectively (relative to world).

searchlight-assault-setting-ignore-entries-list=Ignore turrets matching these semi-colon separated names:

searchlight-assault-override-ammo-range=Override max ammo range?

[description]
searchlight-assault-setting-light-radius=Radius of searchlight's spotlight in tiles (Defaults to 4). Caution: Setting vision distance too low can searchlights to fail to spot foes at all.
searchlight-assault-setting-ignore-entries-list=Each entry should be a turret's prototype name separated by a (;) semi-colon.
searchlight-assault-uninstall=Check this box before uninstalling to destroy this mod's units, and prevent new ones from being built.\nFailing to do this may result in any range-boosted turrets going missing after the mod is uninstalled.
searchlight-assault-override-ammo-range=Enable this option to make boosted turrets override range limitations on ammo so they can still strike distant spotted targets. Disable to respect the max ammo range implemented by other mods.
